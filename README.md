# Seasoning

A recipe app made for a mobile applications module in college as part of a group project.

The app only displays recipes with produce that is local to Ireland and in season. I created a function that compares every ingredient in the recipe to our produce JSON and calcuates the what months it is in season for. The NOW filter sets it to this month or you can change the season. I also made the favourites function and worked on some of the CSS.
